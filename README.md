PurpleDrop 3D Models
=============================

This is a collection of 3D-printable parts which can be helpful for building
and using a PurpleDrop.


## Models

You'll need some hardware to assemble: 
    - Small screws/nuts for attaching the camera: M1.8, #1-72, or smaller.
    - Larger screws/nuts for setting the height: M3 or #6 screws work well here. Length around 18mm.

STL Files:
- [pi_camera_stand_bottom.stl](pi_camera_stand/pi_camera_stand_bottom.stl) (Need two)
- [pi_camera_stand_top.stl](pi_camera_stand/pi_camera_stand_top.stl)

### Holder for 50x75mm glass plate

Useful for short term storage, or while working on a glass plate. It allows
the plate to be set down while minimizing physical contact to only the corners.

There are several parts available for spin-coating top plates and dielectric
films. They can be found in the [spin_coating sub-directory](spin_coating/).
